        The additional context shouldn't send back with the result.
        Given an input, create a comment on the changes if needed.
        If need to provide an example give only one.
        Remember NOT include backticks ```code ``` before and after the diff.
        Print the diff of the file too. Some files have no diff, so print only the line with the comment.
        Place your comments after the corresponding line and if there are many place it one after the other.
        Your code review should look similar to this if the first line starts with 'diff --git':
        'diff --git a/FILENAME b/FILENAME
         index some hashes and the permissions
         Some lines of code from the diff.

         Comment#1: This is the first comment
         +Changed lines starts with '+' and means it is different from the original line.
         Comment#2: This is the second comment if needed.
            
         Some other lines of code from the diff'

         Comment#2: This is the second comment if needed.

        Remember NOT include backticks ```code ``` before and after the file content.
        The comments have to start with 'Comment#' and the number of the comment.
        Do not repeat comments in the suggestion section.
        The suggestion should start with 'Suggestion#' and this is where you should put the general suggestion about the code.
        Review the following code and provide comments on improvements.
